    "# Dataset preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook was created with the goal to extract the data we require from the\n",
    "PokeAPI dataset, the completed dataset process is located in the\n",
    "/data/dataset-assembler.py file. The PokeAPI dataset is an extensive dataset\n",
    "containing all sorts of information about the Pokemon universe, including all\n",
    "the Pokemon, their types and abilities, pictures and much more. We will only work\n",
    "with a small fraction of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will also prepare the pictures of all the Digimon we will use\n",
    "in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasoning\n",
    "The PokeAPI dataset is a gargantuan dataset containing any and all information\n",
    "one could want about the Pokemon universe. However, for our purposes, most of\n",
    "that information is irrelevant and superfluous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our aim is to create a dataset that can classify whether a given image\n",
    "is a Pokemon or not, as well as to classify the Pokemon type based on the image,\n",
    "we only really need the Pokemon names, types, images, and a set of non-Pokemon\n",
    "images to train our model. The rest of this information is irrelevant to our\n",
    "purpose, as knowing for example, a Pokemon's height or weight does not help us\n",
    "identify it through an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Digimon only serve as negative examples of Pokemon, we only need their\n",
    "images and none of the additional information about them that is included in the\n",
    "dataset."
