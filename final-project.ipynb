    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Pokemon is the highest grossing media franchise of all time, leading ahead of other very popular franchises such as\n",
    "Disney's Marvel or Star Wars. The franchise has its roots in a creature-collection RPG video game released back in\n",
    "1996 for the GameBoy console. Since then, the franchise has expanded to include an animated series with 27 seasons as of\n",
    "2024, 23 movies, a trading card game spanning decades, a myriad of licensed toys and merchandise, a video-game series\n",
    "with 41 main games and countless spin-offs, and even a theme park in Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The franchise's main appeal is the fictitious creatures known as Pokemon, which are caught and trained by the people in\n",
    "the Pokemon world for battles. Each Pokemon has a unique style, ranging from cute to intimidating and everything in\n",
    "between, they are classified into one or two elemental types and has a set of unique characteristics that sets them\n",
    "apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telling what a Pokemon is from an image is a task trivial for humans, but as the series has grown from its original 151\n",
    "roaster of Pokemon to include the current 1025 species as of the latest additions in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, it has\n",
    "become a daunting task for anyone to keep track of all the Pokemon species and their types. Additionally, as the series\n",
    "is sure to keep growing, more and more Pokemon will be added, making it even harder to keep track of them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we have devised a project to help Pokemon fans identify whether a creature is a Pokemon and what type\n",
    "it is based on images, and to help identify even future Pokemon species. For this, an image classification model will be\n",
    "developed in order to be able to tell Pokemon apart from creatures in other similar competing franchises such as Digimon,\n",
    "as well as determine the elemental type of the Pokemon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, this model would be only the tip of the pyramid, additional features could be added to turn this into a more\n",
    "useful real application such as computer vision models to identify creatures from video footage for this model to classify,\n",
    "a recommendation system to suggest creatures with an advantage against the identified Pokemon, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this project will be a fun and interesting learning experience and that it builds a solid foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook will include every step, from gathering the data for our model to training and evaluating it.\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images of fictitious\n",
    "creatures as Pokemon or not, and for those identified as Pokemon, to classify them into their respective elemental types.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine if an image of a creature represents a Pokemon or not.\n",
    "2. Determine the elemental type of those creatures identified as Pokemon.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Framing the problem\n",
    "##### Determine if an image of a creature represents a Pokemon or not.\n",
    "In the case of the first objective, the problem involves binary classification, where the model's output needs only\n",
    "to be a yes or no answer to the question \"Is this a Pokemon?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we desire a model capable of identifying Pokemon, supervised learning is the most appropriate approach, as we have\n",
    "clearly labeled data to train the model on. An unsupervised approach would not be appropriate, as allowing the model to\n",
    "find patterns in the data on its own would be a waste of time at best and produce a model with inaccurate results at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the performance of this model, there are a few metrics to take into account:\n",
    "  - The model's accuracy defined by how many guesses are actually correct.\n",
    "  - The model's precision defined as the fraction of the predicted Pokemon that are actually Pokemon.\n",
    "  $$ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}} $$\n",
    "  - The model's recall defined as the fraction of actual Pok√©mon images correctly identified:\n",
    "  $$\\text{Recall}= \\frac {\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives + False Negatives}} $$\n",
    "  - F1 score is also an interesting metric, which is the mean of precision and recall. Since we're dealing with rates,\n",
    "  the harmonic mean is used instead of the arithmetic mean for most appropriate results:\n",
    "  $$\\text{F1} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}$$\n",
    " <!-- [//] # TODO What is binary crossentropy loss? -->\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Determine the Pokemon type\n",
    "In the case of the second objective, the problem involves a multi-label classification, where the model's output needs\n",
    "to be a list of types that the Pokemon belongs to. This is because some Pokemon species have more than one type, and the\n",
    "model needs to be able to identify all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we desire a model capable of identifying Pokemon types, supervised learning is the most appropriate approach, as we\n",
    "have clearly labeled data to train the model on. The same as before, we have already classified data to train our model\n",
    "with, and it helps us speed up the process to get higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the performance of this model, there are a few metrics to take into account, firstly, since this is also a\n",
    "classification problem, the same metrics as before can be used. However, in order to obtain a metric that evaluates all\n",
    "the labels equally (the model can have a high accuracy by guessing the most common type every time, but never get the\n",
    "right answer for other types), the following metric encompasses all the types at once:\n",
    "- Hamming Loss, defined as the fraction of incorrectly predicted labels, either false positive or false negative,\n",
    "  represents the hamming distance between the predicted labels and the true labels, which in turn is the number of\n",
    "  positions in a vector (or array in this case) where the corresponding elements are different.\n",
    "  $$\\text{Hamming Loss} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Incorrect Labels}}{\\text{Total Labels}}$$\n"

    "#### The data:\n",
    "We can see there's an unending list of csv files in the PokeAPI dataset, most of these are not really relevant to us, as\n",
    "we are only interested in the Pokemon species and their types, as such, we will only be using the following files:\n",
    "- pokemon.csv\n",
    "    - This file contains the information of a Pokemon, such as its name, height, weight, and other information, we will\n",
    "    have to trim it but it's a start\n",
    "- types.csv\n",
    "    - This file contains an index of all types of Pokemon, such as fire, water, grass, etc... We will also have to trim\n",
    "    this as we're not interested in the damage class or generation of the type.\n",
    "- pokemon_types.csv\n",
    "    - This file contains the relationship between Pokemon and their types, we will use this to merge the Pokemon and\n",
    "    types so that we can have a single dataset with all our relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The images\n",
    "As we can see, with the Digimon data it's pretty straightforward, we have a folder with all the images, since these are\n",
    "only negative examples of non-Pokemon creatures, we don't need to worry about any additional information about them, we\n",
    "can simply use all of them (despite many being alternate forms, color variations, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the Pokemon images, we have many folders that can be immediately, folders such as badges and items for containing\n",
    "images that are irrelevant to our task at hand. As for the remaining, the types folder is promising but upon closer\n",
    "inspection, it contains images of the type labels in a badge, which isn't useful for us, the only folder that contains\n",
    "the images we need is the `pokemon` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this folder, we have pictures of Pokemon as well as several subfolders, each containing even more pictures of the\n",
    "Pokemon. For briefness, we will refer to the [dataset-readme](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites/blob/master/README.md)\n",
    "in order to obtain more information about the images. We can see that the images are named after the Pokemon's ID, and\n",
    "that they're divided depending on the source game. Most of these contain pixel-art images of the Pokemon, but there is\n",
    "some promising folders that align with the art-style of our negative set of Digimon images, which makes it so that the\n",
    "model will have to rely on the features of the Pokemon to classify them, rather than the art-style.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most promising folders are the `other/official-artwork` which contain artist renditions of every Pokemon and the\n",
    "`other/dream-world` which contain images of the Pokemon in a more cartoony style from the browser game Pokemon Dream World.\n",
    "However, our decision is made easy knowing that the `official-artwork` folder contains images of all Pokemon to date while\n",
    "the `dream-world` folder only contains images of the first 649 Pokemon, which is a subset of the `official-artwork` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we will only be using the `official-artwork` folder for our model, as it contains all the images we need.\n",
